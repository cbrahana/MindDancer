N0000001*: NIN should not come preassigned in a node; if we are importing a node
from the database, than this would be catastrophic. Instead, when we create a 
node, it has a None NIN, or one is specified, but NIN is not changable from 
NODE, and must be done externally.
N0000002*: We are allowed to set everything except links like this, because they
are immutable. links is mutable, so must be set specifically according to

N0000003: UpdateNode should write any changes to the node into the database, in
 the row with the matching NIN.
N0000004: NewLink should create a new link of the type specified in the local
LINKS list, in the DATABASE, inverted in  the database, and inverted in the 
partner Node.
N0000005: Link tuple should look like (NIN_One,NIN_Two,LINKTYPE)
N0000006: This should only be called if we are creating a new node that isn't 
in the database. Otherwise, it's off limits.  
N0000007: Changing the PIN should only really be done if the PIN isn't set yet.
If it is set, than it could mess up a bunch of stuff with access permissions. 
Make the process similar to changing the NIN, where it can only be done by a
database operation or by doing it to a blank PIN.
N0000008: LINKTYPES  will be positive and negative integers. That means that a
forward LINKTYPE is positive, and a reverse LINKTYPE is negative.
